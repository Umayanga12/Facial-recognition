# Facial Recognition System

This project is a facial recognition system that uses the OpenCV library along with NumPy and Image libraries in Python. The system employs the cascade method to detect faces in images.

## Features

- Detects faces in images using Haar Cascades.
- Easy to use and modify for various facial recognition applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) or Pillow

## Installation
